# DevOps Learning Path Dependencies

The learning path outlines a sequence for mastering DevOps skills. Here's a nuanced breakdown of the dependencies:

- **Linux → Docker**: Understanding Linux fundamentals (file system, permissions, process management) is essential before working with Docker, as containers rely on Linux kernel features and many container troubleshooting scenarios require Linux knowledge.
- **Bash → Ansible**: Proficiency in Bash (scripting, variables, control structures) provides the foundation for understanding Ansible, which uses YAML for configuration but often incorporates Bash commands and requires shell scripting knowledge for custom modules.
- **Networking → Kubernetes**: Solid networking concepts (IP addressing, DNS, load balancing, services) are prerequisites for Kubernetes, as its networking model involves pods, services, ingress controllers, and network policies that build upon these fundamentals.
- **Git → CI/CD pipelines**: Git expertise (branching, merging, pull requests) is necessary before implementing CI/CD pipelines, as most pipeline flows are triggered by and interact with Git operations.
- **YAML → Helm Charts**: Understanding YAML syntax and structure is critical before working with Helm Charts, as charts use YAML for configuration and templating.
- **Containers → Orchestration**: Mastering container concepts (images, layers, networking, volumes) should precede orchestration, as Kubernetes and other orchestration tools manage containerized applications at scale.

This progression ensures each technology builds upon previously acquired knowledge, creating a more solid foundation for DevOps practices.
